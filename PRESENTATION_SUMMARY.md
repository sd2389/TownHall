## ❓ Q&A PREPARATION

### Anticipated Questions:

**Q: Why town-based isolation?**  
A: Each town has independent government operations. Isolation ensures citizens only see relevant town data and government manages their specific town efficiently.

**Q: What about data migration?**  
A: Django migrations handle schema changes automatically. Town changes use a two-step approval process with billing address verification.

**Q: How do you handle users who live near town borders?**  
A: Billing address verification ensures users select the correct town. Government officials can manually approve if needed.

**Q: What about spam/fake accounts?**  
A: Each citizen/business requires government approval before access. Rate limiting prevents automated signups.

**Q: How scalable is this system?**  
A: Designed for multi-town deployment. Each town is isolated, allowing independent growth. Can support hundreds of towns.

**Q: What about mobile apps?**  
A: REST API is mobile-ready. Mobile app can consume same API endpoints. Rate limiting supports this use case.
